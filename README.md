# space-invaders
A BSL space invaders game I created as a final project for HtC1: Simple Data, an edX course.

If you have Dr Racket, you can try this game out!

Just run the program and execute: (main 0)

It took me some trial and error to get the invade rate right and if the game is too easy, it can always be adjusted.
